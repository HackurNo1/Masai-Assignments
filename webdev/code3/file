<form action="/submit">
  <label for="username">Enter Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
  <label for="passcode">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="passcode" name="password">
  <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
</form>
Explanation of Changes:

<label> Attribute Correction:

Original: <label Name="username">
Corrected: <label for="username">
Why: The for attribute in the <label> tag is used to associate the label with the corresponding input field. The Name attribute is incorrect in this context.
<input type="text"> Closing Tag:

Original: <input type="text" id="username" name="username>
Corrected: <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
Why: Input tags are self-closing, meaning they don't require a separate closing tag. The original code was missing the closing angle bracket (>).
<input type="password"> Attribute Correction:

Original: <input typ="password" id="passcode" name="password">
Corrected: <input type="password" id="passcode" name="password">
Why: The type attribute was misspelled as typ. This was corrected to type="password".
<button> Tag Correction:

Original: <button Submit>Submit Form</buttn>
Corrected: <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
Why:
The Submit attribute was incorrect. The correct attribute for a submit button is type="submit".
The closing tag was misspelled as </buttn>. It was corrected to </button>.
Why These Changes are Necessary:

Correct Syntax: HTML syntax must be followed strictly for the browser to parse the code correctly. Incorrect attributes, missing closing tags, and typos can prevent the form from functioning as intended.
Label Association: The for attribute in <label> is crucial for accessibility. It allows users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to understand the purpose of each input field. Clicking on a label also focuses the associated input field.
Form Submission: The type="submit" attribute in the <button> tag tells the browser that this button should submit the form data to the server (specified by the action attribute in the <form> tag).
Password Input: The type="password" attribute masks the entered characters, ensuring that passwords are not displayed in plain text.
By making these corrections, the HTML form becomes valid, accessible, and functional.
